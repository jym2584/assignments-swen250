SWEN-250 Activity Reflection

Name: Jin Moon

================================================================
Start Part 1
Estimated Time	00hh 30mm
Plan:
- print "Farenheit-Celcius"
- use for loop from int i = 0; i < 300; i += 20 to print out the
  temp conversion: C = (5/9)(i-32)
- print out the conversion using printf
- return 0;

Complete
Actual Time	01hh 00mm
Tue, Feb 02 actual time: 01hh 30mm

Observations:
- at first I was using syntax from java since they seemed similar but I realize along the way
when trying to compile my code that int i can't be used inside of the for loop
I noticed that I have to declare int i first and then use i = 0 inside of the for loop instead.
- my temp conversion was also printing out errors since I didn't realize i have to do (5/9)*(i-32) since I did it without *
- I was also a bit confused about the printf so I went over the lecture notes to clarify some of the confusions that I had from
the java syntax

Tue, Feb 02: made formatting corrections, took a while for me to notice

================================================================
Start Part 2
Estimated Time	01hh 00mm
Plan:
- replace int to float

Complete
Actual Time	00hh 20mm
Tue, Feb 02 actual time: 01hh 00mm
Observations:
- I converted the int to float, but I also needed to use %.1f which took a bit of time to figure out

Tue, Feb 02:
	I didn't realize the format as well, so it took me a while to format the right side as well.
I looked at stack overflow for a similar problem and I was able to use that to format my code
