SWEN-250 Activity Reflection

Name: Jin Moon

================================================================
Implement code to pass all unit tests

Estimated Time	02HH 00MM
Plan:
- parse through each character and put them into the array
- if newline or comma is found, split that into a single array
- return the char that the array was split on
- iterate through get_field to grab a 2d array on each row, one being the header
- call get_field several more times to get the data points and 2d array
- print the arrays 

Complete
Actual Time	10HH 00MM
Observations:
- I was having trouble understanding how to parse through a file from standard input
- I learned that through my mistake in word count since I was very confused
- I've spent hours trying to debug why my program was hanging since everything else printed but it did not
print to the actual.out file just to find that it worked when I returned ch instead of 0 on my get_field function
- It was very hard but debugging helped, a lot haha.


================================================================
Test correct operation from the command line

Estimated Time	02HH 00MM
Plan:
- Test to make sure that everything prints on the command line

Complete
Actual Time	10HH 00MM
Observations:
- At first I was confused on how to print the lines since I didn't know how to increment on a function
- Then I realize I only had to do a for loop
- My program was hanging and so I was also confused, which was mitigated through debugging
