Start
Estimated Time	02HH 00MM
Plan:
- filter_ch_index
    Iterate over the string
        If the character doesn't contain ch
            Add it to the result index

- filter_ch_ptr
    Iterate over the string
        If the character string doesn't contain ch
            Add it to the copy

- filter_any_index
    Iterate over the string
        Iterate over the string again
            if the string contains any of the characters in remove
                Don't add it
            Add everything else

- filter_any_ptr
    Iterate over the string
        if the string doesn't include any of the characters in remove
            Copy everything over

- filter_substr
    Iterate over the string
        If the character of the string contains the substring
            Skip over the string
        Add everything else

Observations:
- filter_ch_ptr
    Was initially having trouble with appending string to copy, but then I realize it was doing that already
    I didn't know you can reuse p_copy since it is just a nul terminator now
    was having trouble freeing p, but was able to understand bit more of that in office hours

- filter_any_ptr
    Spent a lot of time trying to implement the function until I noticed that you can use the helper function 

- filter_substr
    Spent a lot of time trying to implement the function until I noticed that you can use the helper function 
    Spent the most time on this
