Home Security "C" Project - Part 2

Name: Jin Moon

===========  Level 1  ==========================================
Start
Estimated Time	02HH 00MM
Plan:
- Try to convert everything from arrays to linked lists

Complete
Actual Time	06HH 00MM
Observations:
- I had a lot of trouble implmeneting these methods because it took a lot of time 
to understand linked lists for me personally. When first looking at the skeleton code I felt
overwhelmed on where to start but I eventually was able to get it with a much more clear mind the 
next day. 
- I encountered a few segmentation faults and core dumps but I think that was due to my lack of
understanding of linked lists 
- Sometimes the function would ask for -> instead of . and vice versa, and I was a bit confused by that as well



===========  Level 2  ==========================================
Start
Estimated Time	02HH 00MM
Plan:
- Try to convert everything from arrays to linked lists

Complete
Actual Time	06HH 00MM
Observations:
- During my level one implementation, I thought a few ahead for every function. I think this was a bad idea
and probably contributed to how long it took me to complete level one. 


===========  Level 3  ==========================================
Start
Estimated Time	03HH 00MM
Plan:
- Skip the events we don't want to get rid of
- After we skip the events that we don't want to trim, trim the rest of the events from the linked list

Complete
Actual Time	05HH 00MM
Observations:
- This was more difficult than I expected, I don't know why I was having issues with this but I kept on 
getting core dumps and segmentation faults. Upon doing this step, I always seemed to be one off, which was a bit
difficult to pinpoint. I tried using current and next and current and previous, but the ladder seems to work with the caveot that 
it always trims one less which I wasn't able to figure out. However I had to make a few adjustments in addition to the case of trimming 
up to length 0, which I made it an edge case afterwards. 


===========  PROJECT PART 1 SUMMARY REFLECTION  =======================
(Replace this text with a couple of paragraphs summarizing your
experience with this project. What is too easy or too hard? What
was the most challenging technical problem you faced? How
did your estimated and actual time compare? Did your estimates
improve as you advanced to later stages? Why or why not?)
===============================================================
What was difficult for me was to convert everything to a linkedlist initially. I had the same experience as freezing up
from project 2 part 1 where I stared at the skeleton code not knowing what to do, but after a lot of complentation I was able 
to get something started. I think the most challenging problem was the trimming part since I've had a lot of difficulties with 
the logic. Even though I sketched out what I wanted to do for the trimming, translating it into code didn't seem to work. 
My estimates did not improve because it took me a lot of time to figure out nodes and linked lists. Also another factor would be that 
I did this assignment last minute instead of ahead of time due to a lot of work that was on my plate for my other courses. I thought it 
wouldn't be extrodinarily difficult so I put the project into low priority but I was mistakened and I thought it was a good lesson to learn 
to not get stuck on the assignment the day (and the day before) it's due. All and all, I think I've learned a lot from this project and what 
I need to do to prepare for the final.

I've had help with understanding the logic of Level 3 from Huan Huynh when I kept on getting core dumps from freeing the events
