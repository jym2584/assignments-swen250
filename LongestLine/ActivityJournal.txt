================================================================
Part 1
Estimated Time	00HH 30MM
Plan:
Create a while loop that ends with an EOD
Create an input that takes in strings
Echo it each time you press enter

Complete
Actual Time	00HH 60MM
Observations:
I was having trouble trying to get the scanf, but I was able to get some input by looking
at the course slides.


================================================================
Part 2
Estimated Time	00HH 30MM
Plan:
- Put an if statement on the while conditional
	- if the length of the line is greater than the int longest_line then replace that integer with the larger one
	- copy the line
- after the while conditional, print the longest line

Complete
Actual Time	01HH 10MM
Observations:
- Was having trouble trying to add a loop to iterate through each character
- I looked up the slides for some clarification on getchar() and copying the string
- The unit test was ending the program before I was able to test my line function so I put my code above it
- I placed my code back under the unit test since I wasn't sure if it should've stayed like that
