Start
Estimated Time	05HH 00MM
Plan:
- get characters from standard input
- put them into an array
- pass them with pointers

Complete
Actual Time	07HH 00MM
Observations:
- Was having trouble trying to get from standard input initially and put them into the 2d array, but I was able to get a hand of that
- Wrote most of my code in main, which I realie wasn't something I  was supposed to do
- I also passed in a string array on read_data which was something that I also wasn't supposed to do
- Was having bit of trouble with pointers
- Makefile wasn't working correctly, but I was able to get it working now
- I included a .c file on my main.c which caused the compiler to break
- Code works! Also learned to include global variables on the header file
