SWEN-250 Activity Reflection

Name: Jin Moon

================================================================
Start
Estimated Time	01HH 00MM (5:00 PM EST)
Plan:
- implement passing in file through command prompt
- create a while line != EOL loop
- create a conditional that ignores the whitespace
- create a for loop that iterates through each character in the line, maybe add formatting for word too
- count up characters and words, as well as other things i may need to do

Complete
Actual Time	08HH 00MM   (7:14 PM EST)
Observations:
- Initially I was iterating over whitespace and \n for the word count which gave 68.
It counted both the empty \n with no words and the double space on th 11th line.
It  took me a long time to get it but I was able to search for the problem and resolve it.
- It took me a lot more time than I expected because I was so used to the java syntax, so I had a lot of problem there as well
- The documentation and code examples on the C website was really helpful as well
