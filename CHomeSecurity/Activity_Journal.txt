Home Security "C" Project - Part 1

Name: Jin Moon

===========  Stage 1  ==========================================
Start
Estimated Time	00HH 30MM
Plan:
- Read each line from standard input

Complete
Actual Time	00HH 30MM
Observations:
- Was initially confused about what each method does but I realize the passed in buffer
is actually what each character is going to be filled into

===========  Stage 2  ==========================================
Start
Estimated Time	01HH 00MM
Plan:
- Use something with rooms and events
- Helper function to print the readings of each room

Complete
Actual Time	02HH 30MM
Observations:
- For about 30 minutes, I was looking around the given files to examine the structs
I didn't really know what to do first but thinking incrementally helped
For this case, I added an add_event function that adds the event on the room and such
After that, I understand a little bit more on what to do
- For my read_temp, read_co2 and read_intruder, I had to change the parameters to pass in 
an event_t struct since it wouldn't make sense to keep them as they were originally
        - This helped with being able to print each event of a room 
- Then I added a print_reading which should print them in order now


===========  Stage 3  ==========================================
Start
Estimated Time	00HH 00MM
Plan:
- Was already implemnted from Stage 2 by coincidence

Complete
Actual Time	00HH 00MM
Observations:
- Not really sure how, but I think I looked a step ahead with filling in 
the room_t and event_t struct.
The printing seems to work though


===========  Stage 4  ==========================================
Start
Estimated Time	01HH 00MM
Plan:
- Change add_event so that it supports new events

Complete
Actual Time	00HH 45MM
Observations:
- When shifting elements, I made a little diagram that would help me implement the logic for
adding things when they're already full. https://i.imgur.com/EMT9pW7.png
The visualization helped me a lot in changing the function to use that implementation.


===========  Stage 5  ==========================================
Start
Estimated Time	00HH 00MM
Plan:
- Was already implemnted from Stage 4

Complete
Actual Time	00HH 00MM
Observations:
- The printing seems to work

===========  PROJECT PART 1 SUMMARY REFLECTION  =======================
(Replace this text with a couple of paragraphs summarizing your
experience with this project. What is too easy or too hard? What
was the most challenging technical problem you faced? How
did your estimated and actual time compare? Did your estimates
improve as you advanced to later stages? Why or why not?)

I think this project wasn't that bad, but challenging enough. Some of the technical issues
that I had was the initial phase when starting out with the assignment. On first glance, I
had no clue on what to do until I carefully looked at what each files do, I had to revisit
structs and reading from standard input since the read_line got me the most confused. I think
my estimate and actual times varied due to unfamiliarities on C but I was able to get it done.
My estimate seemed to be a bit better for Stage 4 since all I had to do was add a conditional that
shifts elements if the array is already filled. 

I value this project a lot since I think it combined a little bit of everything that we did
from the first week of the semester. I learned that it's important to look at everything before
starting out on something since it can be overwhelming to immediately try to do something without
a bit of context. The most difficult part for me was both the structs and reading from standard input
but when I looked back at my code, I slowly start to recognize how to go about approaching each
problem.
